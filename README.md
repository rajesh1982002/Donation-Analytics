Thank you for giving me an opportunity to participate in coding challenge. 
Although, I applied for Data Science program I am very honored and excited that 
I was offered to participate in the Data Engineering program.
Please find the attached assignment as requested.

PS 
I have used the file itcont_2018_20171118_20180113.txt for test purposes and since there were
more than 750000 rows my computer couldn't process it all. As for my laptop I could see instant
results for about 2000 rows so i have only submitted the output results for 2000 rows. My sincere apology for the
situation. 

Once again thank you very much for your consideration and time.
